                <!-- <h2 >What is Lolita Fashion?</h2> -->
        
        <p class="desc">Lolita fashion is an alternative street fashion that originated in Japan.  The style is inspired by antique dolls, rococo and victorian fashion, and kawaii culture.  While it's associated with the Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo, it has spread worldwide, and you can find lolita communities in almost every country.  While lolita fashion is mostly about the clothes, lolita fashion is commonly associated with ladylike activities, such as tea parties, museum trips, going to the ballet and opera, and picnics.  </p>
